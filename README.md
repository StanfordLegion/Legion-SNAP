# Legion-SNAP

This is an implementation of the [SNAP](https://github.com/losalamos/SNAP)
mini-application in Legion. This work was done by NVIDIA as part of the
Fast Forward 2 project and was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy
under subcontract B609478 with Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.
The code is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0. A copy of the

Several notes on the code for this implementation of SNAP. 

* This version of SNAP only implements the mini-KBA sweep algorithm
  for performing the computation. It also only supports 3D computations.
  The Legion version issues index space launches for each stage of a
  sweep for each energy group and direction. This allows Legion to 
  extract task parallelism from the different sweeps. This proves
  especially useful for the way Legion performs the GPU computation. 
  The GPU implementation launches a cooperative kernel using a subset of
  SMs per sweep and energy group and relies on task parallelism to launch 
  multiple kernels onto the GPU to keep all the SMs on the GPU busy. This 
  is unorthodox, but allows for a more efficient implementation that can 
  store per-angle fluxes per stream as the kernel sweeps through cells.

* The Legion style of this implementation is designed to illustrate
  how code should be generated from a higher-level compiler or written
  for a domain specific library, with good application-specific 
  abstractions and multiple different task variants for each logical 
  task. This allows the application to specialize itself for different 
  target architectures. The downside is that the code can appear to be 
  verbose. This is not an artifact of Legion, but instead of what needs 
  to be done to make a code portable across many different architectures. 
  In general you will notice that there are very few places where Legion 
  shows up in this code. There are fewer than 100 Legion runtime calls 
  which represents less than 2% of all the code in the application. All 
  of the task variants are highly tuned so it is possible to accurately 
  gauge the runtime overhead that is incurred.

* The Legion version of SNAP also demonstrates the use of custom projection
  functions when performing index space launches for the different sweeps.
  The custom projection functions for SNAP end up projecting from three
  dimensional points for the sweeps down to two dimensional points for
  handling the per-angle fluxes being passed from previous cells as each
  sweep progresses.

* This version of SNAP is the first real Legion application that
  relies heavily upon using predication to handle the dynamic
  convergence tests needed in SNAP. This implementation shows 
  how to chain together predicates to perform the convergence
  tests. It also demonstrates how to use Legion futures and 
  tasks to construct a monad for performing accurate timing of
  tasks in a deferred execution environment (similar to how
  monads in Haskell are needed to handle the laziness of the
  execution model). Users can leverage this as a template for
  handling other kinds of predicated computations that need 
  to be done in a deferred execution model. 

* Included in this version of SNAP is a custom mapper that 
  demonstrates how a mapper can be specialized for a particular
  application by overriding specific calls from the default
  mapper implementation. An interesting observation is that
  the implementation of the mapper calls for a custom mapper
  are considerably simpler than the default mapper 
  implementations. The reason for this is that with an 
  application specific mapper the implementation can be 
  tailored directly to the application and know exactly
  what layouts and locations to use for physical instances.
